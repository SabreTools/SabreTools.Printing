# SabreTools.Printing

This library comprises of code to output human-readable representations of various (usually binary) models. All of the classes here implement the `IPrinter` interface to associate them with a top-level model and utilize `StringBuilder` within `static` implementations.

All functionality from this library has been integrated into [SabreTools.Serialization](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools.Serialization). This repo is now redundant.
